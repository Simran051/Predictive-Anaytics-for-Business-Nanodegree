# Predictive Analytics For Business Nanodegree
This is the repository that contains all the projects that I cover under the Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree Program. All the projects were based on some business problems and these problems were solved using various Machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Boosted Model, time series forecasting, A/B testing etc. all using Alteryx tool. Throughout the entire program, Alteryx tool was used for data preparation and implementation of these algorithms.
